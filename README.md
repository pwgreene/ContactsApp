# ContactsApp

Began the move to Swift 2.0, project worked in Swift 1, but isn't working in Swift 2
  TODO:
  -Change depreciated methods
  -Get resolution to work on Iphone 6/6s (works for iPhone 5 simulator)
  -Test on iPhone, rather than simulator
  -Get source contact database to work over internet
  
Currently the app only works in the simulator within XCode and with a php file and SQL database stored on localhost
